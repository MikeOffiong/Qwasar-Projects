# Welcome to My Cat

## Task
The task is to replicate the behaviour of a systems cat command.

## Description
I used a pointer that points to an array of strings, the code also opens and reads each file and each character in each file, and prints the contents.

## Installation
This project has no need for Installation at the time.

## Usage
The code reads in files specified as command-line arguments and prints their contents.

### The Core Team
This project was completed by Michael Offiong
