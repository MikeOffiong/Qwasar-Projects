## Task
The task was to create a website with Multiple pages, Custom navigation, Custom themes using Wordpress

## Description
I watched videos on how to create a free website using wordpress, after adding the requirements, I launched the website.

## Installation
This project has no need for installation, but was launched in order for it to go live

## Usage
A CMS is used to create, manage, and modify content on a website without knowing how to code. 
It is helpful when working on projects with time constraint.

### The Core Team
This project was completed by Michael Offiong.
