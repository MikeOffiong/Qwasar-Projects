# Welcome to My Spaceship
***

## Task
The goal is to write a code that determines and returns the x and y position,
as well as the direction a rocket ship is facing, after it has gone through a specified flight path in space.

## Description
After calling a function that takes a string of characters, the coordinates, orientaion, and Index were declared and initialized.
I used a FOR loop to iterate through a string of characters(flight path) as long as Index was less than length of the string.
An If else statement was used to make the rocket go R,L,or A when given a flight path, and what to do relative to it's orientaion at the time. 

## Installation
This project has no use for Installation.

## Usage
The code is meant to instruct a ship how to move when given a flight path. 

### The Core Team
The project was done by Michael Offiong.
