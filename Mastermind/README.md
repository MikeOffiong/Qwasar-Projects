# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
The task is to write a program that implements the game Mastermind called mastermind.

## Description
Using the misplaced_count function to count the number of characters that appear in both of the two input string secret_num and random.
The wellplaced_count function to count the number of characters in the input strings secret_num and random that are the same and appear in the same position in both strings.
The valid_guess function checks whether the paraeter guess contains only digits from 0 to 8 and must have a length of 4. Returning 1 if true or  if otherwise.
The read_input function reads the user's input and stores it in a string input.
The main function works the magic, it generates a secret code or uses one provided by a player, prompts the other player to guess and 
uses the wellplaced_count and misplaced_count functions to provide feedback on the guess. The program ends when a user run out of tries or gets a correct guess and prints a congrat message.


## Installation
The program does not have a need for Installation but I ran it with the terminal and it worked fine.

## Usage
This program is designed to replicate the algorithm behind the Mastermind game.
